            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61408:3"/>in their expectation, and ſaluted with a luſty volley of Musket-ſhot from the wals and works, the City of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don having ſent thither before to ſecure the place, a ſtrong Garriſon of able ſouldiers, Prince <hi>Robert</hi> galloped with this unexpected reſiſtance, ſent one with a Trumpet to treate with them within for the ſurrendring the Caſtle, promiſing them faire quarter; but if they reſiſted, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them with all the terrours of death and deſtruction: The Commander within anſwered, That he was to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend that fortreſſe for the King and Parliament, and ſo would doe againſt him and all the world, being neither to be mollified by his faire promiſes, nor terrified with his threatenings, that for any other he ſhould expect none, but what came to him out of the mouth of the Cannon.</p>

Prince <hi>Robert</hi> told them he would not ſtirre thence to diſhonour the glory of his former actions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking that Fort from thoſe Round-heads, and ſo cheered them on to a new aſſault, which was performed very faintly on their ſide, and anſwered on ours with much
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61408:3"/>courage, ſome of the Garriſon ſouldiers ſallying out and beating thoſe Devils away at handy-blowes, they tumbled ſome twelve ſcore of them dead upon the place, which made Prince <hi>Robert</hi> hearken to the former advice, and ſo truſting up his trinkets, and bidding adieu to his Hoſt atthe quarter where he lodged (very courteouſly not paying him a penny for his entertainment) with his company of Rake-ſhames, he ſtrucke up to Stanes ward, killing, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying all before him, and ſo made up as near as he could to Kingſton ward upon Thames, intending if he had poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed himſelfe once of that Towne, to have built a Fort there to impeach all Navigation that way to the City; but being aſſured, both the Trained Bands of Barkeſhire and Surrey were up, and joyned in one Body, with ſome of his Exceſlencies Forces, ſent for the ſecurity of thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, he was reſolved not to advance too haſtily till he had underſtood the ſafety of the paſſage: Maſter <hi>Cary</hi> therefore the Keeper of Mary-bone Parke, a ſtrong malignant, being well acquainted with all the by-wayes thereabouts, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke to goe to Kingſton for intelligence, and ſo in the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of a Miller diſguiſing his face to make him further out of knowledge, he trudged on towards Kingſton, and in the way within a mile of the Towne ſome of our Horſe met him, and not ſuſpecting him by his habit, let him paſſe, till one that came behind knowing him, made a ſtop of him; and hallowing in the reſt of his fellowes, told them that Miller was Maſter <hi>Cary,</hi> and ſo ſearching him found good clothes under his Millers caſe, and money in his Pockets, which making prize of, they carried him to <hi>Kingston,</hi> and there put him in ſafe cuſtody.
